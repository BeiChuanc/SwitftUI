         "content": "While oilcloth is not strictly waterproof, it boasts exceptional weather resistance, keeping you dry for extended periods. We pay special attention to the garment's construction to minimize potential weak points where water might seep through, such as seams and needle holes.

In this video, our Sales Manager, Nic Floyd, will demonstrate how to easily reapply a waterproof coating to your jacket and explain the steps needed to complete this task.",
